# Film-suggestion
What is it?
An algorithm that will compare films the user likes against other films to accurately suggest other films the user will like.
Please not the main file (The one you have to run) is practice data handling.

What I learned:
1) How to implement binary search using classes.
2) Sets vs lists for increasing performance.
3) List comprehensions
4) How to profile code so you can see what lines are taking the longest time to execute.
